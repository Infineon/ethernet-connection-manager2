/**
* @file cy_ecm.h
* @brief Ethernet Connection Manager (ECM) is a library that helps application developers manage their Ethernet connectivity.
* The library provides a set of APIs that can be used to establish and monitor ethernet ports on Infineon platforms that support Ethernet connectivity.
* The library APIs are thread-safe. The library monitors the Ethernet connection and notifies the connection state change through an event notification mechanism.
* See individual APIs for more details.
